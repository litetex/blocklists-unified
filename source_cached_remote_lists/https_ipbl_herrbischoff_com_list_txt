# HERR BISCHOFF'S IP BLOCKLIST (IPBL)
#
# Feel free to use this list without restriction and without guarantees or
# warranties of any kind. I will do my best to keep it updated but that's about
# it. It is refreshed hourly, so fetching more often than that just wastes
# resources. Excessive queries will eventually get you blocked, although not
# necessarily added to the list itself. Just be kind and considerate and
# everything else will follow.
#
# Please note that single IPs are listed as they are, consecutive ranges in
# CIDR notation.
#
# It contains IPs that were caught making requests they were not supposed to
# make. This includes, among other signals:
#
# - attempting to aggressively probe servers
# - attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities
# - being a malware bootstrapping source
# - making repeated automated login attempts
# - repeatedly ignoring robots.txt directives
# - running an unidentified crawler
# - running brain-dead scanning scripts
# - running port scans
# - sending junk email
#
# There is no de-listing process. If your IP is on it, adjust your server's
# behaviour and eventually it will disappear.
#
# This list is only available via HTTPS. The server supports TLSv1.2+, so make
# sure your infrastructure is up-to-date. If you observe any issues with this
# list, please let me know: marcel (at) herrbischoff (dot) com
